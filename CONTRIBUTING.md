# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are encouraged and welcome; to keep things organised, all bugs and requests should be
opened in the github issues tab for the main project, at [gnx/laravel-toolkit/issues](https://github.com/gnx/laravel-toolkit/issues)

Please submit all pull requests to the [laravel-toolkit/develop](https://github.com/gnx/laravel-toolkit/tree/develop) branch, so they can be tested before being merged into the master branch.
